### Codebase 

The entire code has been developed using Python programming language. The recommendation has used ratings for sorting by taking the age, genre and author(where genre and author are optional) as input from the user. The python's sort function uses TIM sort algorithm which is a combination of insertion sort and merge sort making it highly powerful. It's average time complexity is O(n) and worst time complexity is O(nlogn). The space complexity is O(n). The website is developed using Flask. The website asks the user to rate the book recommended which causes change in the rating of the book and is refelected for other users as well as rating is the primary factor for sorting. Users can also add books of their choice which also can be recommended to other users. The feature of rating and adding new is disabled if user is not logged in to ensure authentication.
