### Codebase <img src="https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/3565/3565585.svg" width="24px">

The entire code has been developed using Python programming language. The recommendation has used ratings for sorting by taking the age, genre and author(where genre and author are optional) as input from the user. The website is developed using Flask. The website asks the user to rate the book recommended which causes change in the rating of the book and is refelected for other users as well. Users can also add books of their choice which also can be read by other users. The feature of recommendation is disabled if user is not logged in to ensure authentication.
